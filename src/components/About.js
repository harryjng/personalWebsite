                    I’m a software engineer with a strong foundation in <a href="https://www.akima.com/opcos/cloud-lake-technology-data-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='highlight-word'>full-stack development</a>, 
                    <a href="https://github.com/AwrodHaghiTabrizi/UMARV-CV-LaneDetection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='highlight-word'> machine learning</a>, and <a href="https://zetapi.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='highlight-word'>human-centered design</a>. I’m passionate about building impactful tools 
                    from secure <a href="https://github.com/HostYourVoice/Skilt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='highlight-word'>mobile apps</a> and AI-powered systems to real-time mapping platforms that solve real-world problems. <br /><br />

                    Currently, I’m a Software Engineer at <a href="http://akima.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='highlight-word'>Akima</a>, where I support federal 
                    clients by building internal tools. I recently delivered an XR-based construction 
                    visualization tool, as well as a military-grade emergency response platform. I hold a Secret-level clearance 
                    and enjoy contributing to engineering in the public sector. <br /><br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work spans startups, labs, and <a href="http://akpsports.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='highlight-word'>nonprofit</a> settings. At the <a href="https://rtcl.eecs.umich.edu/rtclweb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='highlight-word'>Real time Computing Lab</a>, I've developed 
                    algorithms to reduce shoulder surfing. I’ve also led <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wolverinesportsanalytics/posts/?feedView=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='highlight-word'>full-stack projects</a> for organizations, improved 
                    automation, and built several AI-powered tools—from a <a href="https://github.com/mandyschen/BWToColorized" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='highlight-word'>colorization model</a> to a real-time NBA 
                    performance predictor.<br /><br />

                    In my spare time, you’ll often find me spending time with friends and family, playing 
                    soccer, and exploring new cities and cuisines.
